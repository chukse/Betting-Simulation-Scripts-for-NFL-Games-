# Betting Analysis with XGBoost

This repository contains Python scripts designed to analyze NFL data and predict betting outcomes using machine learning models, specifically XGBoost. The scripts process advanced NFL statistics and help generate insights for sports betting, focusing on game predictions and betting decisions.

## Files

- **`bet_with_xgboost.py`**: This is the main script for training an XGBoost model using NFL team statistics. It builds a predictive model for betting analysis by processing advanced statistics.
  
- **`bet_without_roster_ratings.py`**: A variation of the main script that excludes player roster ratings from the dataset. This script focuses only on team-based statistics to make predictions.

- **`xgboost_script_update.py`**: An updated version of the betting script, with optimized code and additional features for improved performance and accuracy. It introduces new data preprocessing and model evaluation techniques.

## Datasets

The following CSV files provide the advanced statistics for each NFL season. They are used by the scripts to train and evaluate the betting models:

- **`advstats_season_def.csv`**: Contains defensive statistics for the teams during the season.
  
- **`advstats_season_pass.csv`**: Holds passing statistics for the season.

- **`advstats_season_rec.csv`**: Includes receiving statistics for the season.

- **`advstats_season_rush.csv`**: Rushing statistics for the season are stored here.

## Requirements

To run these scripts, you will need to install the following Python libraries. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install xgboost pandas numpy scikit-learn

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

Ensure that all the necessary CSV files (defense, passing, receiving, rushing stats) are available in the same directory as the Python scripts. The scripts will load the data from these files to process the team and player statistics for the model.

### 2. Running the Script

To run the scripts, use the command line and execute them as follows:

```bash
python bet_with_xgboost.py


## Model Output

The model will output predictions that include:

- **Game Outcome Probabilities**: Predicted probabilities of which team will win.
- **Betting Insights**: Additional metrics or statistics useful for making informed betting decisions.
- **Model Performance**: Accuracy or performance metrics of the model based on the training dataset (if applicable).

The output is printed to the console or saved to a file, depending on the specific implementation of the script.

## Model Overview

The model built with XGBoost focuses on predicting the outcomes of NFL games by analyzing both team and player performance data. Key features include:

- **Team-Based Features**: Statistics such as defense, passing, rushing, and receiving performances from the dataset.
- **Player-Based Features**: (Optional) Individual player ratings that can influence the modelâ€™s predictions.

The model is trained on historical game data and provides predictions about future games. It can be retrained with new season data to stay current with ongoing NFL seasons.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used is **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**, which is highly effective for structured/tabular data. XGBoost is chosen for its:

- Speed and performance with large datasets.
- Ability to handle missing data.
- Built-in regularization to reduce overfitting.

The model operates as follows:

1. **Input Features**: Statistics from the datasets are processed and used as input features.
2. **Model Training**: The XGBoost algorithm trains on historical game data to predict the outcomes of future games.
3. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict the probability of a team winning a game based on the features provided.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future improvements:

- **Incorporate More Features**: Add more detailed player statistics or game-level metadata (e.g., weather, injuries) to improve the accuracy of predictions.
- **Alternative Algorithms**: Explore other machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Neural Networks to compare performance and find the best fit.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web app to allow users to upload data and run predictions without needing to modify code.
- **Improved Evaluation**: Introduce cross-validation techniques to better evaluate model performance on unseen data.

## Model Output

The script will output the following information:

- **Predictions**: The predicted probabilities of each team winning their respective games.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance metrics for model evaluation (if included in the script).
- **Game Insights**: Summary of important statistics that influenced the model's prediction.
